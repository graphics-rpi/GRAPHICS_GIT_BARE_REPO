Moving cursor without input
    Global Zoom
        Centroid / Bounding box as center
        When all cursors are far enough away from edge, zoom in overall texture
        When approaching outside, zoom out
        Adjusting cursor positions
        Defined threshold for zoom speed
            How quickly to adjust the problem.

    Mass spring system? 
        If two users want points close together -> repelling force?

Radii of zoom bubbles
    Outer / Inner zooms.
    3 numbers to adjust on the fly
        inner / outer radius and linear zoom level.
        300, 250, 100x

Interactions between bubbles
    None
    "Tangent"
    Only Outer
    Outer & Inner
    Inner & Inner (related to single merged bubbles, forgo distortion free zone)

Single Merged Bubble
   Centroid / Bounding box. 
   Deciding on merged bubbles.

Graph visualization
    Instead of x position versus distance
    plot original distance versus distance
