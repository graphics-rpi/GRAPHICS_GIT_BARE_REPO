\caption{In Part 1 of the study, participants were asked to sketch the
  lab room and annotate this sketch with their intuition about areas
  with A) too much daylighting, B) too little daylighting, and C)
  potential for glare.  The sketches demonstrate a variety of detail
  and accuracy in the analysis of the dynamic lighting conditions.
