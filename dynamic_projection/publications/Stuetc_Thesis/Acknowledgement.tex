\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
 
I would like to thank my advisers, W. Randolph Franklin and Barb Cutler, for their seemingly endless patience and encouragement. I would like to thank my family and friends, without whose faith in me this would not have been possible. I would like to thank my committee members for the generous commitment of their time, and the rest of the RPI community for providing me with every possible opportunity to succeed.
