To do list for General Cursor:
(B)     - See Calibration below
        - Extension to more cursor types (LEAP motion, touch screens)
        - Multiple screens/same image (iPad collaboration)
(B+C)   - Sort out IDs for lasers/mice (one set of IDs)
*(C)      - Code review of current code
	        - Do applications need cursor IDs nearly as often?
          - Maybe we can call as many functions as possible with an unknown ID/actionID (why do nodes need to know what cursor expanded them?)
		        - actionID (to be renamed) is when an action is assigned an ID and mapped to a laser when it's determined which one performed the action, unknown otherwise
*(C+B)    - ANSWER: Pass around actionID for each gesture/action...All applications require updates
        - Investigation of gestures
(C)       - Gesture user study
		        - User study on intuitiveness of gestures we currently have
		        - Implement new gestures
		        - Rinse and repeat
(C)       - Language of gestures in known applications
		        - Archeology of gestures
		        - Any literature?
	        - How can an application customize our gestures?
	        - How can a user customize the gestures?
        - User study
(C)       - Get IRB approval/training
(C)       - Survey on popular/intuitive mouse gestures
		        - Survey with demonstration videos 
			        - ALlow users to match mouse/laser/cursor gestures with actions
			        - Match gestures with existing applications and interfaces (how do you do this on your iPad?)
(C)       - User study with multiMouse setup
		        - Goal oriented with one user, focus on intuitiveness of gestures
		        - Goal oriented with multiple users and single goal, focus on collaborative problem solving
(C+B)     - User study with lasers
		        - Goal oriented with one user, focus on intuitiveness of gestures
		        - Goal oriented with multiple users and single goal, focus on correct identification of lasers
(C+B)     - Cursor system user study
		        - How effective/friendly is a multimouse vs. a laser?
			        - Do they work well together?
			        - How much better are mice than lasers?
          - Can PI make a Java front-end for Interface class?
(C+Bry) - Can we get data from remote sources (networked computers) for Interaction class
	        - Bryan's Directed Study
	        - How bad is the time delay?
		        - Ask Andrew if he were willing to collaborate with co.llide 


To do list for Laser Personality:

*(C)       - Research safety/confidence in user study
*(B)       - Finish personality "uncertainty" implementation
*(C)       - Collect dataset for remote testing/processing
(C)        - Discretized radial histogram for the laser personality
(C)	        - Distance from screen correction
(C)	        - Skew correction
(B)        - Continual calibration/forgoing initial calibration step
   	        - Part of every application (all cursors)
  	        - Can we use it to learn about user habits beyond just calibrating lasers? (e.g., mouse motion speed)
(B)         - Remove dormant cursors from the system, wipe history, etc.



-----------------------------
Hypotheses

* the grouping gesture is effective at increasing productivity?
  (boring)  individual only, hopefully already been done


* gestures we have chose and they key presses is intuitive
  (individual only)

   - multiple gesture collections (programs A, B & C)

       - try all, which do you prefer

       - train on one, then measure the performance efficiency on that one

       - given one with no instruction at all -- can you figure out
         how to do these tasks (how many failed attempts, what exactly
         were those failed attempts)


* auto - camera (crop & zoom) is effective, clear, not distracting,
  increases productivity, ...  (group!)

    - compare to no camera control (crop & zoom)

    - compare to everyone have control of global camera (crop & zoom)

  NOTE: need good clear group activity & "productivity" measurement 


* mutliple people can simutaneously group/ungroup, expand/collapse
  without interfering with each other

    - more efficient to have many users working together to move object

  NOTE: need group activity to work together (e.g. put the giraffe &
    hippo back in their separate zoo houses -- otherwise they fight)



* overall time to solve is reduced, but number of clicks, number of
  unnecessary clicks goes up for a group

   - run this on puzzle, individual & group


  NOTE: new app!  untangle a graph (turn off all springs completely) 
     - individually?  as a group?
     - do they use group/ungroup, expand/collapse effectively?


* w/ & w/o communication: overall # time of clicks & time to solve
  decrease when talking is allowed


* how effective is the non verbal communication with the interface  [ less priority ]
   - are you aware of the other people
      (which color cursor was the most helpful/productive?, did you
      notice anyone being disruptive?)
   - do you learn from the other people
   - do you work with the other people

   - what if there was an adversary in the group
